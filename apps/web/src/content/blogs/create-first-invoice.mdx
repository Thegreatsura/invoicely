## Core Technologies

### Frontend Framework Selection

When choosing a frontend framework, consider these popular options:

- **React**: Perfect for component-based UIs with a large ecosystem
- **Vue**: Great for progressive enhancement and single-page applications
- **Angular**: Ideal for enterprise-level applications with built-in TypeScript support

### Backend Technologies

Modern backend development offers several approaches:

#### Node.js with Express

- Lightweight and fast
- Great for real-time applications
- Extensive npm ecosystem

#### Python with FastAPI

- High performance
- Automatic API documentation
- Easy to learn and maintain

#### Go

- Excellent performance
- Built-in concurrency
- Strong typing system

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices vs Monolith

| Architecture  | Best For                 | Characteristics                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Monolithic    | Smaller applications     | Simpler to develop and deploy     |
| Microservices | Large-scale applications | Independent scaling, more complex |

### API Design

> **Warning:** Following REST API best practices is crucial for consistency and maintainability.

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body
        className={cn(
          geistSans.variable,
          geistMono.variable,
          jetBrainsMono.variable,
          instrumentSerif.variable,
          instrumentSans.variable,
          urbanist.variable,
          "antialiased",
        )}
      >
        <FumadocsRootProvider>
          <OneDollarStatsProvider>
            <PostHogProvider>
              <JotaiProvider>
                <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" storageKey="invoicely-theme">
                  <ReactScanProvider />
                  <Toaster />
                  {children}
                </ThemeProvider>
              </JotaiProvider>
            </PostHogProvider>
          </OneDollarStatsProvider>
        </FumadocsRootProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Database Considerations

### Database Types

1. **SQL Databases**
   - PostgreSQL
   - MySQL
   - SQLite
2. **NoSQL Databases**
   - MongoDB
   - Redis
   - Cassandra
